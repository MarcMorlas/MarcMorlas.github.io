    <h1 class="big-title">Synopsis</h1>
    <p class="big-text">Wanted: Yokai Uprising is a cooperative first-person shooter game. Take down waves of yokai alone or with a partner. You can choose between two mercenaries with unique play styles to complete the assigned mission and defeat the most wanted boss in town. It also has five different enemies and many power-ups to enhance the gaming experience.</p>

        <h1 class="big-title">Development</h1>
        <h3 class="big-title">Basic Enemy AI</h3>
        <p class="big-text">The basic AI of the enemies is the most essential since all the enemies will inherit from it, I have to point out that all the AI has been made using the Behaviour Trees and Blackboard provided by Unreal 5.2. From this basic AI we can highlight the following aspects: Statistics, Behavior Trees and Blackboards, Perception.</p>
        <h5 class="big-title">Statistics</h5>
        <p class="big-text">The biggest challenge of this section was not the granting of variables to all the actions or states that can have an enemy but, the communication between departments, since WANTED has been a project that has changed a lot throughout the development in the same way they have also changed the “how” the design department wanted to be able to access all this information.</p>
        <h5 class="big-title">Behavior Tree and Blackboard</h5>
        <p class="big-text">Behavior Trees and Blackboards: These elements have been the most important during development, as the Behavior Trees are the foundation of the AI functionality in this project, and the Blackboards are the variables used. As I mentioned before, using these tools provided by Unreal has been quite a challenge. If I had to highlight one of the biggest problems I faced, it would be understanding exactly how the Decorators in the Behavior Tree work. I wasn't sure if the observers were functioning as I wanted until several months into development. On the other hand, fully grasping how loops work within the Behavior Tree, the order between the different branches, and the Sequence and Selector nodes also took me a lot of time. However, I believe that each Agent now has its own Behavior Tree and functions correctly.</p>
        <h5 class="big-title">Perception</h5>
        <p class="big-text">Perception in Unreal has been the toughest challenge I faced throughout the project. At the start, I used the "AI Perception Component" since it seemed the most complete for what the AI needed. I don’t regret using it, but it caused issues until the very last day. Both players have an "AI Stimulus Perception" so the enemies' perception can detect them.

        The first requirement from the design team was for enemies to have "realistic" perception, e.g., if they see a player within their vision range, they would approach them, but when they lose sight, they stop searching. After some time and testing, the design team decided to change this, e.g., once an enemy spots a player, they will follow them until one of them dies.

        A major issue arose with the project's performance, where I found that all enemies were perceiving each other, causing hundreds of checks when many were in play. Another major problem was that, after some time, perception stopped detecting the player even when they were within range. Despite all these challenges, the detection of the player by the enemies' perception now works correctly.</p>

    <div class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start">
        <h3 class="big-title">Melee Enemy (Tengu)</h3>
        <p class="big-text">The Melee enemy has the most basic behavior in the entire project. It will approach the player and attack with a combo of up to three strikes.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The first iteration was very simple: once it spotted the player, it would approach until it could attack, continuing this until one of them died.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The second iteration involved creating four points around the players where enemies could stand to attack. Once these four spots were filled, the other enemies would wait nearby until one became available.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The final iteration introduced a cloud of points forming a cone from the player to the enemy. The enemy would first move to one of those points, then to one of the four near the player, and finally, attack. This last idea became the final one for the project and worked the best based on feedback.

        However, if I had more time, I would have refined it further, as sometimes the EQS (Environment Query System) would select points that weren’t ideal, causing the AI to lose focus on the player.</p>

        <div class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start">
        <h3 class="big-title">Ranged Enemy (Samebito)</h3>
        <p class="big-text">The Ranged enemy is the one that moves away from the player while attacking from a distance.</p>

        <p class="big-text">In the first iteration, the ranged enemy functioned like a turret. When the player got close enough, it would run as far away as possible to continue shooting afterward.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The second iteration introduced some side-to-side movement after attacking to give it a bit more mobility, making it a harder target to hit.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The final iteration, which remained in the final build, was that once the player moved out of the enemy's vision range, the enemy would approach the player until it was back within attack range. With the ranged enemy, there were never any major issues like the ones encountered with the other enemies.</p>

        <div class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start">
        <h3 class="big-title">Tank Enemy (Komainu)</h3>
        <p class="big-text">The Tank enemy shares the same behavior as the melee enemy, but with a special attack. It uses the same four points to approach the player, along with creating an EQS around them.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The special attack initially started as a regular attack that stunned the player for a few seconds before resuming normal attacks.</p>

        <p class="big-text">In the second iteration, the idea was to test making the attack an area-of-effect (AOE) shockwave centered on the enemy's position, but it didn’t work as expected.</p>

        <p class="big-text">The final iteration involved creating a decal on the ground to warn the player of the attack’s range, and then implementing an area effect with that radius, without needing it to scale exponentially.</p>

        <div class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start">
        <h3 class="big-title">Spawner Enemy </h3>
        <p class="big-text">The Spawner enemy is the most fearful of all. Its only function is to summon Booster enemies and then run as far away from the player as possible.</p>

        <p class="big-text">This enemy didn’t require many iterations due to its simple concept.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUN0DlNZ7n0?si=Ofx4CWYBAlTs1NBG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <br>
        <div class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start">
        <h3 class="big-title">Booster Enemy </h3>
        <p class="big-text">The Booster enemy has been the one I've had the most problems with. Its function is to attach itself to another enemy and give it special characteristics. When the Booster is attached, it cannot be killed; only after the player defeats the boosted enemy can they kill the Booster. If the Booster is left without any nearby enemies, it will charge at the player and explode.</p>
        
        <p class="big-text">The initial idea for this enemy was to circle around other enemies to grant them special abilities, such as increased movement speed and shields. The first problem was finding a way for it to circle the enemies at a constant speed without appearing strange to the player. Initially, eight points were placed around the enemy, which the Booster would use as guides, moving from one to the next. While it managed to navigate the points to some extent, when the enemy was in motion, it couldn’t keep up, resulting in awkward movements.</p>
        <p class="big-text"> The second iteration involved placing a single point next to the enemy, so it would no longer need to "circle" around but simply follow that point. This movement worked much better and smoother.</p>

    <br>
        <div class="container d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start">
        <h3 class="big-title">Boss Enemy (The Boss)</h3>
        <p class="big-text">The Boss is the most complete enemy. From the beginning, it was intended to be both a melee and ranged enemy, divided into three phases based on its health.</p>
        
        <p class="big-text"> First Phase: The Boss will approach the nearest player and attack with melee strikes until it completes a combo of three attacks. Once its health drops to a certain level, it will transition to the second phase.</p>
        <p class="big-text"> Second Phase: This phase starts with the Boss attacking from a distance for a few seconds before switching back to melee attacks until it has the chance to attack from a distance again. Additionally, it can heal itself using a sake bottle and will remain static while drinking. During this time, the player can shoot the bottle to prevent healing and stun the Boss for a few seconds.</p>
        <p class="big-text"> Third Phase: In this final phase, the behavior will be the same as in the second phase, but the timing and statistics of the Boss will be improved to its advantage.</p>
        <p class="big-text"> The challenges I encountered with the Boss included determining a priority order for its actions. For example, in the second phase, the order should be: heal, attack from a distance, approach the player, and then attack melee.</p>
        <p class="big-text"> Another issue was modifying the NavMesh of the level, given that the size of the Boss was much larger than the other enemies. It needed to be adjusted enough to ensure that the Boss's movement was realistic and that it wouldn’t get stuck in certain areas or climb onto places it shouldn't.</p>

<h1 class="big-title">PostMortem</h1>
        <p class="big-text">Wanted is my final HND work and has been the largest project I've been on with a total of 16 people working on it, plus two producers with industry experience.
                            My job has been to be totally in charge of the whole AI side of things. It has been quite a challenge, as I had never had so much responsibility in a project of this size and I was not very experienced in Unreal AI either.</p>
   
                            
                     <p class="big-text"> Right now, I would change many things, such as unnecessary checks, the basic structure of the enemies, improving the EQS, and making adjustments to enemy perception. However, despite this, this is the project I am most proud of; it is the largest and has been published on Steam, something I had never done before.

Additionally, I have learned a lot about teamwork, not only within the programming department but also in how to collaborate with all the other departments. Having had milestones throughout the project and several deadlines, I believe I have improved significantly as a programmer and as a worker in terms of time management and maintaining a mental framework for the list of needs and priorities.
